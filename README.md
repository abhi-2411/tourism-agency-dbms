**üöÄ Project Overview**
Travel Agency Management System is a database-centric project built using PostgreSQL to model and manage the operations of a travel business ‚Äî including trips, customers, bookings, payments, agents, and reviews.
The primary goal is to ensure clean data architecture, reduce redundancy, and enforce real-world business rules using relational modeling and constraints.

The database has been carefully designed, normalized up to 3NF, and implemented using pgAdmin. It supports complex queries, views, triggers, and indexing ‚Äî making it efficient for analytics and scalable for 
larger datasets. The project showcases how real-world systems can be mapped into relational structures with integrity, flexibility, and security in mind.

**üîç Features**
1. Well-Normalized Relational Schema: Customers, Trips, Bookings, Payments, Agents, and Reviews ‚Äî each as dedicated tables with proper relationships.
2. Foreign Keys & Cascading Rules: Enforce data integrity and automatic cleanup of dependent records.
3. Constraints: Used for validations like uniqueness, check ranges, and composite uniqueness to prevent anomalies.
4. Triggers: Prevent overbooking by dynamically checking availability before insertions.
5. Views: Created for top destinations, customer activity, and revenue insights to support analytics and reporting.
6. Advanced SQL: Includes usage of set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT), group-by queries, nested subqueries, and indexed searches.
7. Secure Password Storage: Passwords for customers and agents are hashed using pgcrypto functions inside PostgreSQL.

**üõ† Tech Stack**
- Database: PostgreSQL (Designed and managed using pgAdmin)
- Schema Design: Follows normalization principles (up to 3NF)
- Database Access Tool: pgAdmin 4
- Extensions Used: pgcrypto for password encryption
- Additional Tools: psql CLI for executing queries, data seeding, and testing
